<!-- ## About Me -->
I recently received the bachelor degree in Robot Engineering from [Guangzhou University](http://www.gzhu.edu.cn/) in 06/2023. I completed my thesis on driving perception in the Intelligent Vehicle Laboratory, advised by Prof. [Jinhua Zhang](http://jd.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1150/4235.htm). Before that, I interned the [Institute of System Rheology](http://isr.gzhu.edu.cn/), working with Prof. [Xue-Feng Yuan](http://isr.gzhu.edu.cn/info/1259/2240.htm).
### <span style="color:red">(Update June 20, 2023) I am looking for PhD/RA positions. I can start working within a month.</span>


## Research Interests
        
I am generally interested in reinforcement learning(RL) and its application to robotics. To state my research plan and demonstrate my research skills, I wrote a research proposal on [Efficient Vision-Based Reinforcement Learning for Physical Robots](https://yeminghui.github.io/assets/files/Research_Proposal_Minghui_Ye.pdf). I am also open to related topics including but not limited to: 
- Manipulation
- Offline Reinforcement Learning
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
- Vision-Based Control
- Robot Perception
- Large Language Models for Robotic Control
